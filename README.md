# Country IP Blocks

These have a thousand and one uses but are surprisingly hard to come by in
bulk.

* IPv4 and IPv6 ranges available.
* Compiled directly from AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPENCC data.
* Deduplicated and subnets merged for efficiency.
* Simplified and sorted by country TLD.
* CIDR notation.
* Updated hourly, commits only appear when there are changes.

## Women Empowerment in Zanzibar

Send a little karma down the way and support women empowerment in Zanzibar by
helping to [fund the local production of reusable female hygiene
products](https://www.gofundme.com/f/women-empowerment-in-zanzibar). A very
dear friend of mine runs the project. They were already able to buy hundreds of
educational books. Sometimes, it takes so little to make a huge impact. If
you'd like to thank me or support this work, donate. Additionally, any current
and future sponsoring of my work via GitHub or other channels will flow one
hundred percent to the NGO.
