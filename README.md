# Country IP Blocks

These have a thousand and one uses but are surprisingly hard to come by in
bulk.

* IPv4 and IPv6 ranges available.
* Compiled directly from AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPENCC data.
* Deduplicated and subnets merged for efficiency.
* Simplified and sorted by country TLD.
* CIDR notation.
* Updated every 6 hours, commits only appear when there are changes.
